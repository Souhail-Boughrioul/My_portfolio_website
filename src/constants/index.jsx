export const BIO = [
  "Hi, I‚Äôm Souhail Boughrioul, a self-taught front-end developer with a passion for building beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites. Over time, I‚Äôve developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allow me to create responsive and interactive web experiences. I‚Äôve also dived into React.js to build dynamic, component-based applications and embraced Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach to styling, which helps me work efficiently and maintain clean, scalable code.",
  "What drives me is my curiosity and love for problem-solving. Being self-taught, I‚Äôve learned to navigate challenges independently, constantly improving my skills through online resources, tutorials, and hands-on projects. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into reality, paying close attention to detail to ensure my work is not only visually appealing but also accessible and performant across devices.",
  "I‚Äôm always eager to learn and grow, whether it‚Äôs exploring new frameworks, refining my design skills, or collaborating with others in the tech community. My goal is to create meaningful digital experiences that make an impact, and I‚Äôm excited to continue evolving as a developer while contributing to innovative projects.",
